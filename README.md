### SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION - MODULES DESCRIPTION

**User Account:**
The user account registration is the first step for individuals to become members of the cloud service. During registration, users provide essential information such as a username, first name, and gender. Additionally, security measures like a security question and answer, password, and email are set up for account recovery and communication purposes. Optional details like a phone number and address can also be provided. Once registered, users can access various cloud services tailored to their needs.

**Document Key Generation:**
This module is crucial for generating and verifying document keys used to access sensitive documents within an organization. Users submit their unique document IDs, and administrators generate a corresponding key, which consists of complex alphanumeric characters. The key is then used to authenticate and grant access to the specified document. This process ensures that only authorized users can access confidential documents, enhancing security.

**Document Management:**
Users can store and manage a variety of documents, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and image files, through this module. The interface allows easy organization and retrieval of documents. To enhance security, users submit unique credentials along with specific document hints to retrieve files. This multi-step authentication process helps prevent unauthorized access while allowing efficient document management.

**Revamp Room:**
The Revamp Room offers a dynamic approach to data security by generating unique document keys for each login session. If an incorrect key is entered, the system relocates the document to a secure zone, making it inaccessible to unauthorized users. This proactive security measure deters attackers by isolating compromised documents and generating decoy information to mislead unauthorized users.

**Self-Destruction:**
The self-destruction system ensures data privacy by making stored information irretrievable after a specific period or under certain conditions. It employs active storage techniques, including encryption, access controls, and expiration policies, to protect data from unauthorized access. The system automatically deletes outdated data, enhancing security and efficiency.

**Admin Communication:**
Direct communication between administrators and data owners is facilitated through this module, ensuring seamless management of cloud services. Users can address concerns related to accessibility, performance, or security directly with administrators through multiple channels such as helpdesk portals, email, or live chat. This bidirectional communication fosters transparency, accountability, and user satisfaction.
